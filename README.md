# Betting the NFL Over/Under - A Data Science Perspective

**In the United States, over 40 million people bet on National Football League games each year, wagering over $12 billion dollars annually. One of the most popular wagers offered by sportsbooks is the Over/Under (O/U) bet, in which the bettor chooses whether the total score of the contest will be over or under to posted O/U value. In this study, team statistics as well as game conditions are considered in a regression model to determine whether the O/U bet can be predicted with sufficient accuracy as to make the O/U bet profitable.
